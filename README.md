# EconML

The information presented herein is derived from the publicly accessible repository: [EconML](https://github.com/py-why/EconML?tab=readme-ov-file#news). This repository serves as an educational resource for mastering EconML, a Python library designed for the estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects from observational data via machine learning and econometrics to make causal inferences. 

The promise of EconML:
- Implement recent techniques in the literature at the intersection of econometrics and machine learning
- Maintain flexibility in modeling the effect heterogeneity (via techniques such as random forests, boosting, lasso and neural nets), while preserving the causal interpretation of the learned model and often offering valid confidence intervals
- Use a unified API
- Build on standard Python packages for Machine Learning and Data Analysis
